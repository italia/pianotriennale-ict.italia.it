Public Administrations must start upgrading their connectivity in order to provide services related to both internal administrative procedures and public services to citizens and businesses. The strategy behind the realisation of the Plan in terms of connectivity is inevitably connected with the [National Ultra-Broadband Plan] (http://bandaultralarga.italia.it/).

The availability of connectivity in Public Administrations is very diverse. Typically, Public Administrations - especially at a local level - have an underdeveloped situation that does not meet the criteria defined by the Public Connectivity System. By 2017, the PAs must upgrade their connectivity, favouring - in their choice of connectivity services - those in which the transport service is based on the IPv6 protocol.

Several actions are planned for the upgrade of PA's connectivity, including drafting and adapting the guidelines for the construction of public Wi-Fi networks.
