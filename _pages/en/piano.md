The targeted use of new technologies puts citizens and businesses at the centre of the action, becoming the lever of economic and social transformation that renders digital innovation a public investment for a structural reform of the country.

The Three-Year Plan for information technology in the Public Administration is the strategic and economic policy document that turns into action the Strategic Model for the evolution of the public administration information system. It was created to effectively guide Italy&#39;s digital transformation and becomes a point of reference for central and local administrations in the development of their own information systems. 

It defines the guidelines of the operational strategy for the development of public information technology, establishing the fundamental architectural principles, the rules of usability and interoperability, and specifying the logic for classifying ICT expenses. Thanks to the Plan, the following digital development model is established:
 
- at the national level, rules and standards are defined, and enabling platforms that optimise investments are implemented;
- central and local administrations develop services according to their specific needs, using internal and/or market skills;
- the private sector, which includes the country's strategy, establishes long-term investment programs and exploits new market opportunities by creating solutions that integrate with national platforms. 
 
The objective of the Plan is to rationalise the expenditure of the administrations, improving the quality of services offered to citizens and businesses, and the tools made available to the public administrations.
